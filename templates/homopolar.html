    <p>I made homopolar motor kit Christmas presents for my engineering-type friends.</p>

    <p>Here's how they work:</p>
    
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Current flows down through the screw, *radially* outward through the magnet, and back up the wire into the battery.</li>
        <li>The magnetic field from the magnet is vertically aligned through the magnet's axis of symmetry.</li>
        <li>The charges running through the wire (current) feel a force perpendicular to both their direction and the direction of the magnetic field, ie, a tangential force. (this is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force">Lorentz force</a>) This torque makes the screw and magnet spin!</li>
    </ul>
