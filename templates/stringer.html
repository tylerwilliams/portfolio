    There's been a kinect kicking around The Echo Nest office since they came out, and I've been dying for a chance to use it. <a href="http://nyc.musichackday.org/" target="_blank">Music Hack Day New York</a> was that chance. I worked with <a href="http://blog.chenalexander.com/">Alex Chen</a> and <a href="http://www.aidanfeldman.com/">Aidan Feldman</a> to create an invisible string instrument over the weekend.

    <p class="image"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/19934847?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
    
    <p>Alex had ported the strings from his <a href="http://mta.me/">mta.me</a> demo to processing, so we first interfaced a kinect using <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/p5/kinect/">Daniel Shiffmanâ€™s</a> kinect library. This worked really well for a proof of concept, but we wanted some better hand-tracking for our demo.</p>
    <p>I setup <a href="http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles/openni-binaries/20-latest-unstable">OpenNI</a> and <a href="http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles/openni-compliant-middleware-binaries/33-latest-unstable">NITE</a> and got the PointTracker sample running with multiple hands. Everything went swimmingly, so I integrated an <a href="http://www.audiomulch.com/~rossb/code/oscpack/">OSC library</a> with the PointTracker to send OSC messages to Processing. (thanks <a href="http://runningwithdata.com/">Jason</a> for the c++ help!) Every time a new hand is detected, a message is sent to Processing with the hand ID, and from then on its coordinates as it moves are also sent.
