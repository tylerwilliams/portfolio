    <p class="title">Medea Vodka Display</p>
    
    <p>The Medea Vodka display is a really neat piece of kit. It's basically a 5 by 25 pixel LED display that you can program. It just so happens to be wrapped around a bottle of vodka.</p>

    <p>I haven't been able to find it for sale anywhere around Cambridge (supreme, libby's), but for one glorious day a rep was selling it at the liquor store in Davis Sq., and I snagged a bottle. Apparently there are different colors, but blue was all that was available when I got mine.</p>

    <p >The display itself is flexible pcb that fits into a specially formed channel in the side of the bottle and is held on by a translucent rubber band that covers it. There are little recesses in the bottle where the coin cell (cr2032) batteries fit.</p>
    <p>The circuit is a really smart bit of engineering. The two CR2032 lithium batteries are connected in series to hit the necessary voltage for multiple blue LEDs. The PIC chip, which is always “on”, monitors the button states and drives the shift registers. The chip goes into a low power ‘sleep-mode’ when you press the off button. The 4 shift registers are cascaded together, so the PIC shifts in 4 bytes (32 bits), and then latches the shift registers simultaneously, which transfers the bytes from the storage buffer to the output side (LEDs).</p>
    <p >The Atmel memory chip stores any saved messages (and possibly the font). I don't have a PIC programmer, so I'm not sure if the PIC chip is locked  or if you can program it still. The most interesting thing to me is the lack of current limiting resistors; they are not necessary because the batteries can't source enough current to burn out any LEDs, but this also saves a ton of space! A side effect of saturating the battery's capacity is that the voltage fluctuates massively: from about 4.4V to 5.5V as a message scrolls by with more or fewer 'pixels' lit. But the microcontroller does not brown out!</p>
    <p >Using a multimeter and Eagle CAD I tried to sketch out the circuit a little bit to help myself with programming an AVR to drive the display. This is what I came up with:</p>

    <p >It's not perfect, but it should convey the basic idea.</p>
    <p >Hopefully this helps you get started playing with this display, if you can find one. It's especially cool to find that a display like this that isn't tamper proofed with gobs of epoxy. Props to Medea for that! 
    
    <p>After spending some time understanding how the Medea vodka LED display was wired, I really wanted to use it in some kind of project. I had some LINX wireless modules lying around, so I made a wireless scrolling LED marquee. I had never worked with a scrolling display before, so I had to start from scratch. This is how I made it...</p>

    <p class="image"><a href="/static/images/completed.jpg"><img src="/static/images/completed.jpg" alt="" title="completed display"/></a></p>

    <p>The first thing I had to do was figure out how to control the LEDs. The way this LED display is driven (like most) is with shift registers.  There are 4 shift registers, each with 8 outputs for up to 32 pins. Only 30 are used; they're connected to the 25 columns and 5 rows of the LED matrix. Because an entire row or column must be illuminated at once, the traditional way to display arbitrary 'stuff' is:
    <ul class="list">
    	<li>Turn on/off all columns for row i.</li>
    	<li>Illuminate row i.</li>
    	<li>Let row i = i+1 and repeat the procedure.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>By doing this very quickly, thousands of times per second, the eye is fooled into thinking that all rows / columns are on/off at once.
    It didn't work the first time, but after figuring out the right offsets for each bit I was able to turn on and off any individual LED. I was still a ways from scrolling text though. In fact, before I could even display static text, I needed to get a font.</p>

    <p>Luckily, <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1234005825" target="_blank">on the Arduino Forum</a>, someone had already created a 5x5 pixel font! Each letter in the font is an array of 8, but really 5 bytes, each byte made of 8, but really 5 relevant bits. So to display a letter you would write each successive byte to a successive column. I dropped this into my code as a PROGMEM array (so it gets stored in flash instead of SRAM) and had a sideways letter displayed in no time.</p>

    <p>It was at this point that I realized I wanted a new, better font with more symbols, just like the Medea vodka bottle comes with. I found a font <a href="http://www.dafont.com/5x5.font" target="_blank">here</a> in .ttf format that was free for personal use, but I couldn't figure out a simple way to convert a .ttf file into a numeric description of pixels. After wasting an hour looking for some kind of font converter, I stumbled across <a href="http://code.google.com/p/led-matrix-tools/" target="_blank">a great set of tools</a> for designing symbols for LED displays. I modified it slightly to dump byte arrays in my font format, and then recreated each glyph in the font by hand.</p>

    <p >The new font took up so much space that it didn't fit on my Attiny2313, and I had to switch to an Atmega8. I also stopped at this point to make a PCB with a wireless module on it (while it's possible to prototype wireless circuits on a breadboard, the breadboard's crappy connections make it really tough to track down problems). The wireless part of the circuit is basically taken straight from the LINX RXM-433-LR datasheet. This is what it looks like:</p>
    
    <p class="image"><a href="http://fr.ac.tl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/circuit_brd.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-318" title="circuit_brd" src="/static/images/circuit_brd.png" /></a></p>
    
    <p>I usually have to go through a couple revisions of PCB to work out the kinks, and this board was no exception. On the first iteration I left out the crystal, on the second I made the ISP pads too small and they lifted off, on the third I changed to a different regulator and on the fourth, I finally got it right! After connecting the display and porting the tiny2313 code, I was ready to make the characters on the display scroll.</p>
    
    <p>There are probably more efficient ways to do this, but I made a buffer representing the state of all pixels which the interrupt routine uses to continuously update the LED states. The main loop  of my program fetches one column of the current character, shifts the entire buffer one pixel left, and appends this last column. After it's appended all the columns for a single character, it fetches the next character in the message.</p>
        
    <p>Getting the wireless to work was the most finicky part of the project. I left two debug points on the circuit to connect a serial device directly for debugging, and I designed the communication protocol assuming I would talk to the device with serial over a wireless link. The wireless modules will basically pipe an input on the TX side to an output on the RX side, so I assumed I could just connect TX and RX to serial ports that I wanted to talk, but I soon found out that only about 1 in 20 messages would go through the link. The reason is that the serial data coming from an avr's UART is not balanced --- it doesn't have the same number of on and off states per time. This can lead to the transmitter or receiver becoming biased and not decoding everything. The right way to deal with this is to use something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_code" target="_blank">Manchester encoding</a>, which has at least one transition per bit, and therefore no DC component. But this was more work than I was ready to do. A cheap way of doing Manchester encoding is to send two bytes instead of one, with each byte the complement of the other. This helps enough to make the transmission work >90% of the time, and is really simple to implement, so I used it. </p>

    <p >The last step was to get a box to hold the circuit and display. I found a 1.5" deep 3"x5" wood frame at my local art store that was perfect. To mount the display, I replaced the coin cell batteries with magnets, and then I also attached magnets to both inner edges of the frame. The magnets hold everything together securely and the LED display can still be rotated and removed to work on it.
    </p>

    <p >This project took me about 3 weekends to finish, even though I had basic display functionality working after only a few hours. The little things take the most time. The final product still has a few bugs, for example the display will stop scrolling if left alone for 24 hours or so, and it will glitch while receiving data, but overall this project was a success and I learned some of the basic mechanics of a scrolling LED display! I hope you can pull something useful out of it. Check out the video below for the final product.</p>
